# Hasher

Welcome to Hasher, my SHA512 implementation witht the help of openssl.

This is a fun project that I also made since I hash files a lot and prefer to do it on my own.

# How to build?

To build do:

```
git clone https://github.com/aikooo7/Hasher && cd Hasher && cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build
```
Then for run do:

```
