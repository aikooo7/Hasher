# Hasher

Welcome to Hasher, my SHA512 implementation witht the help of openssl.

This is a fun project that I also made since I hash files a lot and prefer to do it on my own.

# How to build?

To build do:

```
Clone the repo and:

cd Hasher && cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build && sudo make install -C build
```
Then for run do:

```
